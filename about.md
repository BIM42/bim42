Hello, my name is Simon Moreau, and I am the one behind this blog.

I received my master's degree in civil engineering from the École Spéciale des Travaux Public in Paris, France. After working on large international projects and developing parametric models on complex framing, I joined the building engineering consultancy Ingérop in the coordination department. Since 2016, I am part of Bouygues Immobilier, one of the largest French real estate developer, and I am working on the development of Building Information Modeling in the company.

You will find in this blog my personnal thoughs around Building Information Modeling and other related matters. I also hope you will forgive mistakes coming from a non native English speaker.
