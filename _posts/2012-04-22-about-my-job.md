As a part of the building information systems department, I&#8217;m involved in the development and implementation of BIM in our design process. This implies various tasks, from finding new software solutions to assure in-house user support.

The main part of the job, the so-called BIM Manager thing, is to organize the design process around chosen BIM software. Creating model templates according to the specification of the company, organizing multi-users modeling around a main model and providing users support are among the everyday tasks.

Apart from the in-house building design, we have also created BIM specific solutions for design offices or general contractors. These solutions range from synthesis and coordination at the early stage of a project to BIM facility management on existing buildings.

Finally, I try to keep in touch with all the BIM-related solutions, following the evolution of the information technology for building construction, from code-driven form-finding to on-site management using tablets and cloud-hosted solutions.
