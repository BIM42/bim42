First of all, welcome to the BIM 42 blog, dedicated to Building Information Modeling and some related subjects.

Following advices from WordPress, I try to answer a few questions about this new blog, just to be sure I may have something worth to say.

**What am I going to do with this?**

In this blog, I will talk about information technology in the AEC industry. BIM is the main topic, but some digressions about visualization, documents management, pure 3D modeling or anything else will be common.

**Who is going to read this?**

This blog aims to be accessible by anyone from the building industry, BIM expert or not. Most post will be technicaly oriented, but I will try to keep in mind all those who aren’t spend their days in modeling softwares.

**What kinds of information will I be posting?**

For the most part, I will post comment on BIM software like Revit, Digital Project, Navisworks, and probably many others. I will also share some more general thoughts about BIM concepts, information technology applied to construction, and evolutions in the process of designing buildings.

**Why am I doing this?**

It’s my job. I’m working in the BIM department of a French engineering office and as a part of my job, I have to keep myself up to date with all BIM related solution and implement them in my company.

**Who am I doing this for?**

For myself, and for anyone interested in Building Information Modeling and related subjects.

**How often am I going to be posting and adding information?**

I’ll try to write post on a weekly basis, but don’t expect to much of me…
