There is no easy way to override the color of an entire Revit link. Since most of my work involves linking Revit model from various subcontractors, this is something I miss badly.

Until recently, I was still using some [workset hack](http://bim42.com/2013/02/revit-linked-models-visibility/) to create filters on linked models. These filters were allowing me to display linked model with my color of choice.

But relying on workset leave much to be desired, and I have to find another solution.

I recently came up with [a different solution](http://bim42.com/2015/07/model-timestamp/), where each model element know where they came from.

The idea is to add file name, date and version in shared parameters on every model element. I created the corresponding Revit Add-In, and it is now available on the [Autodesk App Exchange](https://apps.exchange.autodesk.com/RVT/en/Detail/Index?id=appstore.exchange.autodesk.com%3Atimestamps_windows64%3Aen).

This application will:

  * Ask for identification information
  * Create four shared parameters on every category
  * Fill these shared parameters with identification information

The code itself is pretty easy, but there is a lot of applications.

First, it becomes easy to create filters on linked model. These filters allow us to display each linked model with a different color.

But it also enables us to tag the origin of every element, like we can see in the following screenshot.

You can create a linked models schedule, with date and version.

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-932" src="http://bim42.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/LinkedFilesSchedule.png" alt="LinkedFilesSchedule" width="800" height="336" srcset="https://bim42.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/LinkedFilesSchedule.png 800w, https://bim42.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/LinkedFilesSchedule-300x126.png 300w, https://bim42.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/LinkedFilesSchedule-500x210.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" />](http://bim42.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/LinkedFilesSchedule.png)

To help you create filters and tags with these parameters, you will find [here](http://bim42.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/BIM42_SharedParameters.txt)Â the shared parameter text file. Please also note that the application uses a list of categories to create the four shared parameters. You will find this list [here](http://bim42.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/categories.txt).

I hope this application will help you in your work, don&#8217;t hesitate to share your suggestions in the comments.
