Today, it will not be a blog post but an invitation.

Next week, the [BIM World event](http://www.bim-w.com/?lang=en) will be held in Paris. This event will gather a large panel of architects, engineers, contractors, manufacturers, and software developers, all interested in Building Information Modeling and related technologies.

I will be representing my company [Ingérop](http://www.ingerop.com/) here, and will present our last projects using BIM.

I will also give a short speech ["Développer les compétences du BIM"](http://www.bim-w.com/program26) about implementing Building Information Modeling in an engineering consultancy firm, and the consequences of this paradigm shift.

I would be happy to meet you there and exchange with you, so if you happen to be in Paris next week, the exhibition will be held on Wednesday and Thursday at the CNIT Center in La Défence.

See you there ... .
