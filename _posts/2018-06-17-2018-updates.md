description: My yearly Revit plugin updates
---

Three of my applications have been updated for Revit 2019. Room Finishes, Time Stamper and bimsync4Revit now support Revit versions from 2016 to 2019.

The most important change this year is the migration of all code to Github. I also add a proper Readme explaining these applications and how you can contribute to them. I hope this will encourage anyone to propose Pull Requests, point out issues or simply ask for new features.

All source code is now licensed under the MIT licence. As usual, feel free to use this code in your own applications.

Aside from this, there is not much improvement this year except a few bug fixes, so I will just take that as an opportunity to present you again these three tools.

# Room Finishing

Room Finishing is my oldest Revit plugin. You can use it to model skirting boards and floor finishes based on rooms.
To model skirting boards, the application uses a user-created wall type on a specific height to model a skirting board all around a previously selected room. You can also run the command on all visible rooms.

You can find more details [here](https://www.bim42.com/2016/07/room-finishes-update-2/), [here](https://www.bim42.com/2014/08/room-finishes-update/) and [here](https://www.bim42.com/2014/02/modellingskirtingboards/).

The application is availlable on the [Autodesk App Store](https://apps.autodesk.com/RVT/en/Detail/Index?id=5641957956279354474&appLang=en&os=Win32_64), and the source is available on [Github](https://github.com/simonmoreau/RoomFinishes).

# Time Stamper

Time Stamper add file name, date and version in shared parameters on every model element.

With all these information, you can:

* Keep track of the origin and authoring date of each element in complex project
* Quickly compare two versions of a Revit file and graphically display their differences
* Create view filters for every linked Revit files
* Create a schedule of all linked models, along with their authoring date and origin
* Export the information in IFC, and get them on your favorite project review software.

# bimsync

bimsync4Revit is an unofficial Revit plugin for bimsync. You can use it to upload your model to bimsync without having to quit Revit. This plugin makes use of the Revit custom IFC Exporter and you can select your own IFC configuration.
