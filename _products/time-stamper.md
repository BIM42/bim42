Keep track and manage the origin and authoring date of every Autodesk® Revit® element.

By adding some revision information on every element of a given Revit model, Time Stamper allows you to keep track of your model's history. With all the information, you can:

* Keep track of the origin and authoring date of each element in complex project
* Quickly compare two versions of a Revit file and graphically display their differences
* Create view filters for every linked Revit files
* Create a schedule of all linked models, along with their authoring date and origin
* Export the information in IFC, and get them on your favorite project review software.
