Creating architectural details for shop drawings can be particularly long and tedious when it comes to modeling every detail in a room.

The Room Finishing application allows you to automatically create a skirting board or a finished floor all the way around any architectural room.

Just create a type of wall to be used as a baseboard or a type of floor to be used as a finish, select a set of rooms or a single room and the application will create the skirting board and the finish with the proper height.
